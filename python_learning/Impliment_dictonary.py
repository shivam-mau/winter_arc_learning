'''You are familiar with most of the properties of dictionaries in Python. Let's get this into head by solving a problem.
The task is to do operations as described below:

k key, v value: Insert given key k and value v in the dictionary, print 'Inserted' 
after inserting.
d key: Delete the entry for a given key d and print 'Deleted' if the key to be deleted is present, else print '-1'.
p key: Print marks of given key p in statement as "Marks of {student_name} is : {marks}". If key is not present print '-1'.
Avoid using F-string in your python solution code
Examples:

Input:
dhi ankit
100 200
harsh 300
harsh
harsh
Output:
Inserted
Deleted
-1
Explanation: First two lines take my_dict input as key and values. Then, insert and del 
operation happens, correspondingly Inserted and Deleted is printed. For last query,
harsh key 
is not present so -1 is printed.
Input:
harsh ghutra mith
100 200 300
ankit 400
mith
ankit
Output:
Inserted
Deleted
Marks of ankit is 400
Explanation: First two lines take my_dict input as key and values. Then, insert and del 
operation happens, correspondingly Inserted and Deleted is printed. For last query,
Marks of ankit is 400 is printed.'''

# Taking input and initializing dictionary
keys = input().split()

my_dict = dict(zip(keys, values))
k, v = input().split()
v = int(v)
########### Write your code below ###############
# Insert k,v in my_dict
my_dict[k] = v

d = input()
########### Write your code below ###############
# Delete entry with key d from my_dict
if d in my_dict:

p = input()

########### Write your code below ###############
# Print marks of given key p if key present, else print -1
if p in my_dict:
