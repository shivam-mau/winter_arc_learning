Add a window function
Fantastic! You now have a result set that retrieves the match date, home team, away team, and the goals scored by each team. You have one final component of the question left -- how badly did Manchester United lose in each match?

In order to determine this, let's add a window function to the main query that ranks matches by the absolute value of the difference between home_goal and away_goal. This allows us to directly compare the difference in scores without having to consider whether Manchester United played as the home or away team!

The equation is complete for you -- all you need to do is properly complete the window function!

Instructions:-
Set up the CTEs so that the home and away teams each have a name, ID, and score associated with them.
Select the date, home team name, away team name, home goal, and away goals scored in the main query.
Rank the matches and order by the difference in scores in descending order.
